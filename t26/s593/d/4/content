For purposes of determining whether any interest in a REMIC qualifies under the preceding sentence, any interest in another REMIC held by such REMIC shall be treated as a qualifying real property loan under principles similar to the principles of the preceding sentence, except that if such REMICâ€™s are part of a tiered structure, they shall be treated as 1 REMIC for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
