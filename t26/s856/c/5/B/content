The term “real estate assets” means real property (including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property or on interests in real property), shares (or transferable certificates of beneficial interest) in other real estate investment trusts which meet the requirements of this part, and debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs. Such term also includes any property (not otherwise a real estate asset) attributable to the temporary investment of new capital, but only if such property is stock or a debt instrument, and only for the 1-year period beginning on the date the real estate trust receives such capital.
