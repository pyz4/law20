In computing the gain the decedent would have had if he had lived and sold the stock, his basis shall be determined without regard to the last sentence of section 996(e)(2) (relating to reductions of basis of DISC stock). For purposes of this subsection, the estate tax valuation date is the date of the decedentâ€™s death or, in the case of an election under section 2032, the applicable valuation date prescribed by that section.</p>
