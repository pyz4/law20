If (by reason of the death of any individual, or by termination or distribution of a trust in accordance with the terms of the trust instrument) by the due date for filing the estate tax return (including any extension thereof) a reformable interest is in a wholly charitable trust or passes directly to a person or for a use described in subsection (a), a deduction shall be allowed for such reformable interest as if it had met the requirements of paragraph (2) on the date of the decedent’s death. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “wholly charitable trust” means a charitable trust which, upon the allowance of a deduction, would be described in section 4947(a)(1).
