A trust forming part of a pension plan to which section 430(j)(4) or 433(f)(5) applies shall not be treated as failing to constitute a qualified trust under this section merely because such plan ceases to make any payment described in subparagraph (B) during any period that such plan has a liquidity shortfall (as defined in section 430(j)(4) or 433(f)(5)).
