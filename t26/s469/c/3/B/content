If the preceding sentence applies to the net income from any property for any taxable year, any credits allowable under subpart B (other than section 27) or D of part IV of subchapter A for such taxable year which are attributable to such property shall be treated as credits not from a passive activity to the extent the amount of such credits does not exceed the regular tax liability of the taxpayer for the taxable year which is allocable to such net income.</p>
