If the prevailing commissioners’ standard tables as of the beginning of any calendar year (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the “year of change”) are different from the prevailing commissioners’ standard tables as of the beginning of the preceding calendar year, the issuer may use the prevailing commissioners’ standard tables as of the beginning of the preceding calendar year with respect to any contract issued after the change and before the close of the 3-year period beginning on the first day of the year of change.</p>
