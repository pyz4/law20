If for any taxable year such deductions exceed such income, the excess shall be treated as a deduction attributable to furnishing services, insurance, goods, or other items of value to members paid or incurred in the succeeding taxable year. The deductions provided by sections 243 and 245 (relating to dividends received by corporations) shall not be allowed to any organization to which this section applies for the taxable year.</p>
