In the case of a project described in section 142(d)(4)(B), the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting “170 percent” for “140 percent” and by substituting “any low-income unit in the building is occupied by a new resident whose income exceeds 40 percent of area median gross income” for “any residential unit in the building (of a size comparable to, or smaller than, such unit) is occupied by a new resident whose income exceeds such income limitation”.</p>
